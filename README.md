To create a dynamic webpage based on available UFO data, using JavaScript.

Results

With the webpage functionality completed, you will now be able to filter on any one or more criteria. The available criteria, currently, are date, cit, state, counrty, and shape of the reported UFO. The filters can be found to the left of the data table, which is just below the introductory paragraphs.

For example, if I want to see triangular shaped UFO's seen in New York, type "ny" for state and "triangle" for shape. The results will show that there was only one such occurence which was in New Paltz, NY on 1/5/2010 and lasted 45 seconds.

Summary
-------
This is certainly a powerful website which will allow the end user to pull out specific information based on their search criteria, but it requires a bit too much manual input which will cause issues in retrieving data. Here are two recommendations to further develop the page:
* Instead of having the user manually enter their search criteria, it would be more efficient to have dropdown menus that the user can choose from. This will also address the issue of any missing data by only showing what is available. 
* This is more art than science but there needs to be some effort on the data cleansing front - none of the city, state, and country information has the correct capitalization and this would go along way in creating a more professional presentation.
